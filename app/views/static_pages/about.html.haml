  %b QA Career Change
  is about changing our lives for the better, its about improving our professional life specifically and knowing that
this power to be either a location independent software professional earning $80k (on average) working as a year QA
tester, also probably gives you the option of working this job in the city of your choice. This can and will positively affect many parts of
our lives, because where you live is an important aspect of the quality of our lives, a QA Career Change gives you
freedom, and having an in demand skill set and the ability to get paid for it, ensures our quality of life is high. For
example, if you have a specific place you want to live, after completing the QA Career Change course, you will have a
highly in demand skillset with the ability to find great paying work almost anywhere.

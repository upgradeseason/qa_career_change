%h3 What is a QA Career Change?

%p
  Basically, it's working with a team of software developers to test their code for bugs.
  %p
  If you can read and write, you can probably work in QA testing.
  %p
  The average salary for QA tester is $80,000 per year in America.
  This could work out really well for you, personally and professionally.
  %p
  What is involved in QA testing?
  %p
  A simple example is:
  %p
  Imagine you want to log into a social media site.
  You enter your username, and then intentionally enter the wrong password.
  Do you see a red error message?
  Congratulations you just completed your first test as a QA!
  %p
  Our small team of software engineers and QA instructors each started working in QA.
  Whether you want to learn to write code or secure a well paying job in QA.
  We can teach you what you need to know to start working in either profession.
  %p
  We recommend starting with QA before coding because you learn a lot of useful information about software by working as a tester.
  %p
  It
  %b is 
  doable for you.
  %p
  Send us an email saying you'd like to get started working as a QA tester at
  %a{:href => "mailto:qacareerchange@gmail.com"} qacareerchange@gmail.com 
  to begin.
  %p
  Unfortunately, the way the world works is: The people who know the information that you need to change your professional and financial life cannot teach for free, but we think you'll find their fee reasonable and there is no reason why you shouldn't recoup this investment in yourself your first week on the job!
